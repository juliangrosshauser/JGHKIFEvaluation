# JGHKIFEvaluation

I'm currently evaluating iOS UI testing options.  
This is just a simple project to try out [KIF](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF).

You need to clone this repo with `--recursive` to also clone the submodules:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/juliangrosshauser/JGHKIFEvaluation.git
```
