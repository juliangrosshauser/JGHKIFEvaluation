I'm currently evaluating iOS UI testing options.  
This is just a simple project to try out [KIF](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF).

In order to run this project you need to checkout KIF with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) first:

```shell
$ carthage update --no-build
```

As of now KIF doesn't have a dynamic framework target, so Carthage can only checkout KIF but not build it.
